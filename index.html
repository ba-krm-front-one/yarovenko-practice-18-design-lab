                <p> Before we sign a contract or write a line of code our team will spend the necessary time needed to
                    understand your product vision. <br>
                    The outcome of this scoping session is a proposal or high-level statement of work.
                    <br>
                    Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or just the pieces you need.
